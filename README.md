- **Categories:** Clear, Rusty, Half-Rusty, Rotten
- **Metrics:** Scarcity, Relative Scarcity, Normalized Scarcity, Value
## Usage
- **Google Spreadsheet:**
- `MetalCollection.xlsx`: Contains data on metal pieces.
- `SimulationFormulas.xlsx`: Explains the formulas used for simulation.
- **Simulation Process:**
1. Calculate Relative Scarcity.
2. Normalize Scarcity Values.
3. Assign Values to Categories Based on Scarcity.
- **Adjustments:**
- Modify formulas based on preferences. - Regularly update spreadsheet data.
